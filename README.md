Welcome to my github page. Currently, there's not much to see, since I mainly contribute to self-hosted git servers. But, I am planning to change this in the future 😊

I am currently open for job offers. If you are interested, shoot me a message on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-kanduth-7458b8198/)!
